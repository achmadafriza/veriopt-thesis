\chapter{Conclusion \label{sec:conclusion}}

In order to provide a solver-based tools for identifying incorrect optimizations, we introduced VeriTest: a software interface 
for automatic verification of GraalVM's expression optimizations. The main goal of this project is to integrate VeriTest into 
the GraalVM development workflow to assist developers in verifying proposed optimization rules without requiring expertise in formal 
proof systems. Through leveraging Isabelle and their automated tools such as Sledgehammer, Nitpick, and Quickcheck, VeriTest demonstrated 
its capability to detect malformed and incorrect optimization rules, and provide automatic verification of optimization rules.

Through the design patterns and algorithms that VeriTest has implemented, it has demonstrated its capability to provide fast and comprehensive 
analysis for verifying optimization rules. Producer-consumer pattern and sufficient mutual exclusion locks implemented inside ensured efficient 
processing for Isabelle invocations without bottlenecks. Furthermore, VeriTest displayed it's extensibility for future refinement through its use of 
bridge and facade design patterns -- abstracting Isabelle interactions and minimizing tight-coupling.

While the evaluation of VeriTest on Veriopt's current theory base and GraalVM's source code annotation suggests that VeriTest cannot replace 
manual verification, it has demonstrated its potential in automatically verifying optimization rules; implying that the percentage of 
optimization rules that \emph{can} be automatically proven will improve as the collection of theories grow. Limitations were identified, 
particularly in VeriTest's ability to find counterexamples, due to the inherent limitations of Nitpick and Quickcheck. Despite these challenges, 
the tool provided valuable insights to previous works done and acts as a starting point for further refinement and expansion.

\section{Possible Future Work \label{sec:future_work}}

Due to the limitations of VeriTest in finding counterexamples, a potential direction for VeriTest's development is to enhance 
its capabilities and address the limitations found. To implement a more robust method for finding counterexamples, VeriTest can be 
extended with an interpreter capable of statically analyzing the semantics of Veriopt's domain specific language and transform it into a more 
robust theory to analyze, similar to Figure \ref{fig:ConditionalEvaluation}. Additionally, Isabelle's Quickcheck and Nitpick can be customized 
to suit the needs of GraalVM's intermediate representation through extending Isabelle/Scala and Isabelle/ML. This would greatly enhance 
VeriTest's capabilities, while still utilizing the framework that VeriTest provided.

Furthermore, the theory base for GraalVM's intermediate representation should be extended such that it would represent a 
comprehensive baseline for verifying expression optimizations. Currently, theorems and lemmas inside Veriopt are created specifically for verifying 
one optimization rule. A more generalized and comprehensive theory base would immensely improve VeriTest's capabilities.

Another key fact that VeriTest demonstrated is that it is a \emph{generalized} interface for interacting with Isabelle. As such, VeriTest 
can be extended to automatically verify different compilers, given a \emph{sufficient} formal specification for it's intermediate representation.
Furthermore, the algorithms used in VeriTest to ensure parallel processing and mutual exclusion can be used by Isabelle to enhance Isabelle Server's 
capabilities, alleviating Isabelle Server's current limitations.

Furthermore, to support VeriTest's integration towards GraalVM's development workflow, it is necessary for VeriTest to be catered towards 
\emph{how} the developers would interface with VeriTest. This can be in the form of syntax highlighting inside a code editor, or through an 
interface -- similar to Alive -- that can display the analysis for optimization rules in a more human-readable form.

Overall, while VeriTest has shown promising results, continued development are necessary to fully realize its potential as a 
comprehensive tool for automatic verification of compiler optimizations.
