I would like to thank my supervisors, Prof. Mark Utting and Prof. Ian J. Hayes, for their continued support and advice. Your guidance is 
what allowed me to learn and grow over this past year. I am grateful for the opportunity to work on this topic that I love. 
I apologize if you had to learn latin throughout reviewing my drafts.

I would also extend my gratitude towards my supervisor, Brae J. Webb. You have been an immense help towards my thesis, and I really appreciate your 
constant feedback and assistance. Thank you for introducing me to this field in Computer Science. This topic sparked my interest in 
the field that I didn't know existed, and I am grateful.

Finally, thank you Nadhila for always being a constant in my life, through our ups and downs. Thank you for your enduring support throughout 
the year. You believed in me even when I had lost hope, when I didn't believe in myself. I haven't been the most loving person, 
but you certainly are. I am eternally grateful to have you in my life, and I certainly cannot do this without you and our pigs. 
It's your turn next year my love, and I certainly believe that you can do this as well.
