\section{Project Plan}
% From the Project Proposal marking sheet:
%   - A well justified, comprehensive, and feasible list of milestones.
%   (with resources and duration).
%   - A complete and accurate risk and/or ethics assessment.

This project would require several milestones to be completed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Understanding Isabelle System (September);
    \item Creating a Proof of Concept (PoC) for the Automated Testing Framework (September - January);
    \item Refining the PoC to be usable in a production setting (February - May).
\end{enumerate}

Furthermore, it would require a considerable amount of time for myself to complete the requirements for the course, namely:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Progress Seminar (Due 9 October 2023);
    \item Conference Paper (Due 9 May 2024);
    \item Poster \& Demonstration (Due 17 May 2024);
    \item Thesis Submission (Due 3 June 2024).
\end{enumerate}
