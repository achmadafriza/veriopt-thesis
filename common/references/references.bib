		As software becomes larger, programming languages become higher-level, and
		processors continue to fail to be clocked faster, we'll increasingly require
		compilers to reduce code bloat, eliminate abstraction penalties, and exploit
		interesting instruction sets. At the same time, compiler execution time must
		not increase too much and also compilers should never produce the wrong
		output. This paper examines the problem of making optimizing compilers
		faster, less buggy, and more capable of generating high-quality output.

During this period we reported more than 325 previously unknown bugs to compiler developers. Every compiler we tested was found to crash and also to silently generate wrong code when presented with valid input. In this paper we present our compiler-testing tool and the results of our bug-hunting study. Our first contribution is to advance the state of the art in compiler testing. Unlike previous tools, Csmith generates programs that cover a large subset of C while avoiding the undefined and unspecified behaviors that would destroy its ability to automatically find wrong-code bugs. Our second contribution is a collection of qualitative and quantitative results about the bugs we have found in open-source C compilers.},

		Ensuring that compiler optimizations are correct is important for the
		reliability of the entire software ecosystem, since all software is compiled.
		Alive [12] is a tool for verifying LLVM's peephole optimizations. Since Alive
		was released, it has helped compiler developers proactively find dozens of
		bugs in LLVM, avoiding potentially hazardous miscompilations. Despite having
		verified many LLVM optimizations so far, Alive is itself not verified, which
		has led to at least once declaring an optimization correct when it was not.

		Presents an optimization verifier for LLVM written in Lean. Improving on the
		prior work of Alive which relies on the trusted code base of the LLVM
		semantics, verification condition generation, and the SMT solver. This paper
		addresses the trusted semantics of LLVM via randomly generated IR programs.
		The trust of the SMT solver is addressed by comparing the SMT expressions
		with equivalent expressions in Lean. The implementation is limited to integer
		transformations ignoring procedure calls.

It limits resource consumption by, for example, unrolling loops up to some bound, which means there are circumstances in which it misses bugs. Alive2 is designed to avoid false alarms, is fully automatic through the use of an SMT solver, and requires no changes to LLVM. By running Alive2 over LLVM’s unit test suite, we discovered and reported 47 new bugs, 28 of which have been fixed already. Moreover, our work has led to eight patches to the LLVM Language Reference—the definitive description of the semantics of its IR—and we have participated in numerous discussions with the goal of clarifying ambiguities and fixing errors in these semantics. Alive2 is open source and we also made it available on the web, where it has active users from the LLVM community.},
