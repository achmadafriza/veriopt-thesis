	abstract = {Choosing hardware for theorem proving is no simple task: automated provers are highly complex and optimized programs, often utilizing a parallel computation model, and there is little prior research on the hardware impact on prover performance. To alleviate the problem for Isabelle, we initiated a community benchmark where the build time of HOL-Analysis is measured. On \$54\$ distinct CPUs, a total of \$669\$ runs with different Isabelle configurations were reported by Isabelle users. Results range from \$107\$s to over \$11\$h. We found that current consumer CPUs performed best, with an optimal number of \$8\$ to \$16\$ threads, largely independent of heap memory. As for hardware parameters, CPU base clock affected multi-threaded execution most with a linear correlation of \$0.37\$, whereas boost frequency was the most influential parameter for single-threaded runs (correlation coefficient \$0.55\$); cache size played no significant role. When comparing our benchmark scores with popular high-performance computing benchmarks, we found a strong linear relationship with Dolfyn (\$R{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.79\$) in the single-threaded scenario. Using data from the 3DMark CPU Profile consumer benchmark, we created a linear model for optimal (multi-threaded) Isabelle performance. When validating, the model has an average \$R{\textasciicircum}2\$-score of \$0.87\$; the mean absolute error in the final model corresponds to a wall-clock time of \$46.6\$s. With a dataset of true median values for the 3DMark, the error improves to \$37.1\$s.},
