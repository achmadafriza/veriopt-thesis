	abstract = {The new Quickcheck is a counterexample generator for Isabelle/HOL that uncovers faulty specifications and invalid conjectures using various testing strategies. The previous Quickcheck only tested conjectures by random testing. The new Quickcheck extends the previous one and integrates two novel testing strategies: exhaustive testing with concrete values; and symbolic testing, evaluating conjectures with a narrowing strategy. Orthogonally to the strategies, we address two general issues: First, we extend the class of executable conjectures and specifications, and second, we present techniques to deal with conditional conjectures, i.e., conjectures with premises. We evaluate the testing strategies and techniques on a number of specifications, functional data structures and a hotel key card system.},

It heuristically selects relevant facts and, if an ATP is successful, produces a snippet that replays the proof in Isabelle. We extended Sledgehammer to invoke satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers as well, exploiting its relevance filter and parallel architecture. The ATPs and SMT solvers nicely complement each other, and Isabelle users are now pleasantly surprised by SMT proofs for problems beyond the ATPs’ reach.},

	abstract = {Isabelle/HOL is a popular interactive theorem prover based on higherorder logic. It owes its success to its ease of use and powerful automation. Much of the automation is performed by external tools: The metaprover Sledgehammer relies on resolution provers and SMT solvers for its proof search, the counterexample generator Quickcheck uses the ML compiler as a fast evaluator for ground formulas, and its rival Nitpick is based on the model ﬁnder Kodkod, which performs a reduction to SAT. Together with the Isar structured proof format and a new asynchronous user interface, these tools have radically transformed the Isabelle user experience. This paper provides an overview of the main automatic proof and disproof tools.},
